# WildBerriesWithGloAcademy

## *Description*

Intensive with GloAcademy, where I worked with:
- inputs,
- rendering pages from the database,
- adding goods to the cart,
- worked with the cart,
- worked with localStorage;

After all I:
- calculated the total cost of all selected goods;
- received the name and phone number from the user, added it to the "body: JSON.stringify" and "post" with the selected goods;
- cleared inputs, cart and localStorage after sending;
- added input verification;
- the send was rejected before filling in the inputs;
- added a pop-up window after sending.
